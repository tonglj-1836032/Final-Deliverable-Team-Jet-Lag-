p("Coronavirus is a hot topic this year, people around the world are
hugely affected by it. As international students, we are facing many
difficulties due to coronavirus. It affected our lives in so many ways.

people in this complex situation. We hope that our design could help people
gain insights and reduce their stress, informing the public of the effect of
COVID-19 on education, transportation, and work. We also want to go further
by adding information about where you could get a covid test and which
hospital you could go to for help."
